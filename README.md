# Bayesian

This is me teaching myself a crash course in rJAGS.

### Seabirds Dive Data 
The Seabird Dive dataset contains records of dives in 108 European shags, common guillemots, and razorbills. Truthfully, this dataset is likley not the best suited for Bayesian modeling as I selected it early in the learning process (and to appeal and be relevant to BRI). 

"Completed"
- EDA
- Data preprocessing
- Model definition
- Data bundling
- Initialization
- Parameters
- Running the model
- Static map visualizations

To-Do
- Checking convergence (currently 
- Trace plots
- Plot posterior mean regression line
- Autocorrelation
- Perhaps a boxplot?
- Interactive map visualizations
- Markdown

### Second Project - dataset more closely aligned to BRI objectives

Possible data sources
- Movebank: animal tracking data
- Marine Megafauna Movement: data on marine species
